        I was a matriculated student in Boston and Saudi Arabia, with English and Arabic as the language of instruction respectively. At the age of 19, I dropped out from <a href="https://www.umb.edu/academics/csm/computer_science/ug/computer_science_bs" target="new">UMass Boston</a> as I worried about the tuition and my familyâ€™s financial situation. Lacking awareness of career planning, my only concern was paying back to my family for my expenses in Boston. I remained as an unskilled laborer even after I became a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/profiles-lawful-permanent-residents#:~:text=Lawful%20permanent%20residents%20(LPRs)%20are,and%20%22green%20card%20holders.%22" target="new">Lawful Permanent Resident</a> in 2016. It was not until a time of adversity in China that I finally identified my career orientation, at the age of 26. <br><br>
        During my days at <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/cn/en/pages/technology/solutions/global-delivery-center.html" target="new">Deloitte China</a>, I would pull an all-nighter and stay in the office until 1 am just to learn <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/cn/en/pages/technology/solutions/sap.html" target="new">SAP ABAP</a> myself. For the first time in my life, I discovered my own potential in developing applications. Although I was dismissed later, I began to explore Consulting and a variety of technologies. I started to contemplate the quality of education I am receiving and the effort I devote to study. It also enlightened me with the importance of building connections to employers and building a technical portfolio prior to graduation. On top of that, I realize my dire need of attaining English proficiency to secure a career in professional services. <br><br> College is a miniature reflection of society. Sociologically speaking, as I was experiencing transition from adolescence to early adulthood, being isolated involuntarily by the surrounding majority Arabs and Africans and trying to survive cultural shock in a gender-segregated environment as the only American Asian at the same time have a huge impact on my personal growth and development. Completing my study in the US and working as a part-time or full-time Intern, happen to be the perfect resolution of the underlying late maturation crisis.
